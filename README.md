Dot files to my linux rice!

[TokyoNightDark](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbB0vIEhlec/)  
[TokyoNightPurple](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZq7D17h8rV/)

I am currently limiting the number of dotties to only 2 of them as I am unable to get all of the stuff here (no github pro).

# Other matters:
It should be noted these dotties were used for XFCE don't come complaining to me if it does not work for your DE (or whatever you use honestly, including TWM). There will be tutorials that will be featured on my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Pendragonscode). Small snippets will be posted on youtube some time later. I will not be very active due to the crazy workload I am under from national exams. Should there be any issues just contact me using my [site](https://code.senghong.xyz)!
